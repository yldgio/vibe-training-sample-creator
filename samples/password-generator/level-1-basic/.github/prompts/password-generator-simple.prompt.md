# Password Generator

Create a secure password generator web app using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

## Requirements

- Single-page app with a clean, responsive layout
- Input controls to configure:
  - Password length (8–64 characters)
  - Include uppercase letters
  - Include lowercase letters
  - Include numbers
  - Include symbols
- A "Generate password" button that creates a new password based on the selected options
- A read-only text field that shows the generated password
- A "Copy" button that copies the generated password to the clipboard and shows a brief confirmation message
- Basic accessibility (labels associated with inputs, sufficient contrast, focus styles)

## Output

Return three separate files:
- `index.html` for the HTML structure
- `styles.css` for the CSS styling
- `script.js` for the JavaScript functionality

Make sure the JavaScript uses clear, well-named functions and avoids external dependencies.
