# Level 1: Basic - One-Shot Prompting

This directory contains a basic example of prompt engineering for a coding agent.

## Concept: One-Shot Prompting

One-shot prompting involves providing the model with a single example of the desired output or style. This helps constrain the model's creativity in specific areas (like design) while letting it handle the logic.

## The Task

Create a secure password generator web app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Files

- `prompts/password-generator-simple.prompt.md`: One-shot prompt with minimal guidance.
- `prompts/password-generator-better.prompt.md`: Improved one-shot prompt with clearer structure and constraints.
