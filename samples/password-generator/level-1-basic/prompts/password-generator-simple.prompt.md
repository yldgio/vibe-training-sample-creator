You are an expert front-end developer.

Create a secure password generator web app using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

Requirements:
- Single-page app with a clean, responsive layout.
- Input controls to configure:
  - Password length (8–64 characters).
  - Include uppercase letters.
  - Include lowercase letters.
  - Include numbers.
  - Include symbols.
- A "Generate password" button that creates a new password based on the selected options.
- A read-only text field (or similar) that shows the generated password.
- A "Copy" button that copies the generated password to the clipboard and shows a brief confirmation message.
- Basic accessibility (labels associated with inputs, sufficient contrast, focus styles).

Output:
- Return three separate code sections: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Make sure the JavaScript uses clear, well-named functions and avoids external dependencies.
