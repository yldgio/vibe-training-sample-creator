# Level 3: Advanced - Planning & Multi-Agent Orchestration

This level showcases advanced prompting patterns for building a coordinated **multi-agent** workflow that plans, implements, and validates a secure password generator web app.

Key ideas:
- A **planner** agent that turns requirements into a concrete, phased plan.
- An **implementer** agent that writes code following the plan.
- A **tester/reviewer** agent that evaluates the result and proposes fixes.
- A **coordinator** that orchestrates the flow and hand‑offs between agents.

Use the agents and prompts under `.github/` to drive this workflow.
