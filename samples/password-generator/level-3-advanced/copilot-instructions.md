# Password Generator – Level 3 Advanced Mode

You are working in an advanced, planning‑driven setup for the password generator project.

- Use the **planner**, **implementer**, **tester**, and **coordinator** agents under `.github/agents/`.
- Use the prompts in `.github/prompts/` to guide planning, risk assessment, execution, and hand‑offs.
- Always maintain a clear plan, track progress, and update the plan when new information appears.
